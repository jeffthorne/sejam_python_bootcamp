# Most commonly used language in infosec [Pentesting, packet manipulation, CI/CD]


'History''''
Python was conceived in the late 1980s, and its implementation began in December 1989 by
Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands
'''

'Dynamic Language'
'''
Python is strongly typed as the interpreter keeps track of all variables types. 
It's also very dynamic as it rarely uses what it knows to limit variable usage
'''


'Benefits of Python'
'''
Presence of Third Party Modules
Extensive Support Libraries: internet protocols, string operations, web services tools,and operating system interfaces, etc
Open Source and Community Development
Learning Ease and Support Available
User-friendly Data Structures: Python has built-in list and dictionary data structures which can be used to construct fast runtime data structures
Productivity and Speed
