"Py Ingredients: [Variables], Numbers, Strings"

'''

	* In Python, everything: booleans, integers, floats, strings, even large data structures, functions, and programsâ€”is implemented as an object. 
	* An object is like a clear plastic box that contains a piece of data

'''

a = 7
print(a)
print(type(a))

a = 2
b = a
a = 3

#### print(b)   # What does b equal now?
